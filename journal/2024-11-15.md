# November 15, 2024 Log Record

The captain's logbook date is November 15, 2024 05:36.

The last time, I decided to rearrange the documents, add some models, etc. But I know myself; I just need to see the improvement and output of the current models. So, today I focused on two main topics.

- Adding more textbooks.
- Trying the model after completing the training.

## Textbooks

I asked Google to select the writers whose books would be used in the training. I also added some writers from my childhood. The result list are the below.

After selecting the list, I checked the text files. The books were in various randomized styles. So, if I couldn't find a better way, the cleaning phase would not work properly.

In the Romeo and Juliet I get the content between **ACT I** and **END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG** lines. Like the same way, I would get the content between **START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG** and **END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG** lines. Some of the irrelavent text can be tolerated (I guess 🫣).

## First try after training

This time, I will only share the training results and infrastructure configuration, because I want to talk about the important part of this journey. TRYING THE MODELS.

Training result was like that.

I asked the results to ChatGPT and ChatGPT said you need to make these on the below list.

- Clean the data.
- Change Tokenizer.
- Add more data to teach the English
- Or just use the pre-trained model.

There is a long journey on my way, I guess.
